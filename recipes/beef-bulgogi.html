    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>TBulgogi, sometimes known as Korean BBQ beef, is a dish of thinly sliced grilled steak that has been marinated in a sweet soy, sesame, and garlic sauce. If you want to spice it up, serve the beef in lettuce cups with rice and hot pepper paste (gochujang).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flank steak (Can be substituted for skirt steak or hanger steak)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Green onion and garlic</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flank steak in a shallow bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients and whisk until blended. Pour the marinade over the steak â€” make sure the meat is completely covered. Cover the bowl and allow the beef to marinate in the fridge for about an hour.</li>
        <li>On a lightly oiled grill set to high heat, cook the beef until it's charred and completely cooked through. This should take about 1 or 2 minutes on each side.</li>
    </ol>
